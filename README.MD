This is an extremely basic example of using the groovy language.

See my blog for an explaination of the code.

Running Samples:

   Before running these samples, download and install the latest version of groovy.

   Long program startup problems??? Several of these samples have dependencies that aren't
   included in the Groovy distribution. These dependencies are annotated in the sample application
   using Grape dependency management. These annotations instruct Groovy to download any missing
   dependencies and transient dependencies needed to run the script. Long story short - if you're
   class path is missing needed dependencies, startup may take a long time as these dependencies
   are downloaded into the ~/.groovy/grapes dependecy cache.
